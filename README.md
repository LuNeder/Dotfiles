## What's here?
- Compiz
- Emerald
- XFCE
- Polybar
- Rofi
- Maybe more

## Dependencies
Make sure you have installed
- Compiz, Emerald and its plugins:
  ```bash
  sudo zypper in compiz compiz-branding-openSUSE compiz-emerald compiz-emerald-theme-manager compiz-emerald-themes compiz-manager compiz-plugins compiz-plugins-experimental compiz-plugins-extra compiz-plugins-main compizconfig-settings-manager python311-compizconfig
  ```
- XFCE
- Polybar: `sudo zypper in polybar`
- Rofi: `sudo zypper in rofi`
- [adi1090x's themes for Rofi](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi)
- ULauncher
- Plank
- [feather font](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes/blob/master/fonts/feather.ttf) (you can install it with [font-manager](https://software.opensuse.org/package/font-manager))
- Maybe something else I forgot

## Instaling
- Make sure you've installed all dependencies and that they're all working properly
- Before going to the next step make sure you have an extra wm installed and working that you can login to, just in case you have any problems. OpenSUSE comes with IceWM installed by default no matter what DE you chose at installation
- Make compiz your default compositor
  ```bash
  xfconf-query -c xfce4-session -p /sessions/Failsafe/Client1_Command -t string -sa xfsettingsd

  xfconf-query -c xfce4-session -p /sessions/Failsafe/Client0_Command -t string -s compiz -t string -s ccp

  ```
- Move Polybar's `config.ini` file to `~/.config/polybar/` and `.restpolymain` to your home
- Move (and replace) Rofi's `launcher.sh` and `style-1.rasi` to `~/.config/rofi/launchers/type-3/`
- Open CompizConf and import Compiz's file. You'll have to change skydome settings to point to the `80894-360render.jpeg` image you downloaded
- Add `polybar main` to you XFCE's startup programs on settings
- Import the xfce-panel file into your xfce-panel backup page
- The Plank configuration is basically default
- Install and apply ULauncher theme [WhiteSur Light](https://gist.github.com/gornostal/02a232e6e560da7946c053555ced6cce?permalink_comment_id=3649821#gistcomment-3649821)
- Configure keyboard shortcuts as you please
- For the wallpaper, download [Mutazione](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1080750/Mutazione/) and take a screenshot in your preferred location (also make sure to play it, it's really the best game ever made). My current one is Kai on the Papu Tree
- You'll probably have to change the temperature and gpu modules in polybar to fit your system
- I think that's it!

If you're having any problems or if there's anything missing to get to a similar result to mine, let me know!

## Credits
The rofi configuration was fully made by [adi1090x](https://github.com/adi1090x/), all I did was change the opacity.
The skydome for compiz was made by [BARDEG](https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1003000/) on xfce-look.org.
The Oxygen theme for Emerald was made by Juan and is included in Emerald, I simply edited it to fit my uses.
The polybar `config.ini` file was made based on the example file that comes with it.
Special thanks also go to Tarc√≠sio from GELOS for helping with using `xconf-querry` to use compiz without workarounds.

## License
These are just dotfiles, so I don't care much about that so consider them licensed with unlicense. The obvious exception to this are files that were not initially made by me, those are included in the above credits section and should be considered to have their original licenses. Basically you can use and edit these dotfiles as much as you'd like, as long as you don't break other people's licenses. Do note that I'm not responsible if you break your system.
